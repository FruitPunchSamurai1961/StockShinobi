## Introduction/Background

There are a variety of ways to get information about your public investments, but not in a centralized way. Our app provides crucial information and visualization for both non-experienced and experienced traders to better understand and manage their investments. It is important to state that we do not provide financial advice but aim to give the user an easier way to view stocks and investments by limiting the information displayed to the user. This helps mostly to introduce non-experienced traders to the world of stock trading and this is where Stock Shinobi comes to play. Stock Shinobi serves as a one-stop shop for amateur stock traders looking to break into algorithmic trading. Its core purposes include:

Stock Analysis: Providing a platform to view real-time stock prices and the performance of said stock during fixed periods decided by the user.

Backtesting: Enabling users to select specific stocks and apply various trading strategies to backtest their performance against historical data. This allows users to evaluate the effectiveness of their strategies.

Profit Prediction: Offering a preliminary estimate of potential gains or losses based on historical trends and user-defined parameters.

Education: Educating users about trading strategies and market dynamics, thus helping them enhance their trading skills.

User Management: Allowing users to create accounts, log in, and log out. This feature facilitates personalized experiences and data management.

Our form of project management for this app was to use a hybrid version of the Waterfall methodology. We followed a structure of completing deliverables, which was an initial testing documentation as well as an initial progress report, then followed up with iterative coding tasks. While we followed this aspect of waterfall, we had to implement Agile methodology to compensate for the shorter time frame and do 2 week long sprints. The sprint backlog as well as product backlog was modified many times to meet deadline goals. This is the preferred project management approach for this project.

## Literature Review

Related stock market websites similar to ours are sites like yahoo finance and google finance. Our project aligns with these websites in how we both visually represent the changes in stock price over time in different ranges such as a month, year from when it started ago. These sites also show relevant news articles and even top gainers and losers stocks. Our site diverges in how we centralize all this information that normally exists in different pages that you have to navigate through. We believe this makes it more convenient than these other websites even though they have more features. We also have features such as being able to write notes about different stocks. We believe these aspects help us stand out against these other existing solutions.
