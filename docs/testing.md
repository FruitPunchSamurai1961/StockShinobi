- Unit testing

    - Test specific functions related to data extraction and calculations for displaying historical stock data
    - Ensure individual methods behave correctly

- Integration testing

    - Test entire classes and functions in conjunction with each other
    - Simulate user requests to check correct system behavior
    - Verify different requests are handled properly

    - To make sure the system is functioning correctly and data fits the right parameters
    - Validate all major marketable features
